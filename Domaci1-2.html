              <h2><center><strong><em>Night Before the Battle</em></strong></center></h2>
                The sword realised it liked neither <u>wars nor battles</u>. It decided it preferred to live in peace and spend its time taking part in tournaments and competitions. So, on the night before what was going to be the big <span style="color:red"><b>final battle</b></span>, the sword tried to find a way to prevent it from taking place. After a while, the sword started to vibrate. First it gave out a <small>low buzz</small>, but this gradually <span style="color:red"><b>got louder</b></span>, until it became an annoying metallic noise. The swords and armour of the other soldiers asked the King's sword what it was doing. It told them: <i>"I don't want there to be a battle tomorrow. I don't like war".</i><br><br>

                <b>One answered</b>: <i>"No one likes it, but what can we do?"</i><br><br>

                <i>"Make yourself vibrate, just like I'm doing"</i>, said the <strong>King's sword</strong>. <i>"If we make enough noise no one will sleep."</i><br><br>

                So the weapons started vibrating, and the noise <strong>became deafening</strong>. It was so loud that it reached the enemy camp, and the weapons there, who were equally sick of the war, <span style="color:blue">joined the protest</span>.<br>
